The discrepancies you're seeing with the real-world domain scores (Yahoo: 40, CNN: 70, Apple: 66, Google: 40) indicate that the scoring model is still overly stringent or misaligned with actual industry practices. Many prominent domains use configurations that balance security, deliverability, and practical operational concerns.

To resolve this clearly, let's **simplify and recalibrate** the scoring model using realistic criteria based on actual major domain setups. This new model will:

- Reflect actual common industry practices.
- Assign clear, reasonable point values.
- Clearly differentiate between "good enough," "excellent," and "poor" setups.

## Revised & Realistic SPF/DKIM/DMARC Scoring Model

### 1. SPF (Total 30 points)

| Criterion                   | Points           | Explanation                                           |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SPF Record Exists           | **10 pts**       | Presence of SPF (`v=spf1`). Essential security baseline.|
| Proper SPF Syntax           | **5 pts**        | Correct syntax, no parsing errors.                   |
| "All" Mechanism (`-all`)    | **10 pts**       | Maximum points for strict/hard fail policy.          |
| "All" Mechanism (`~all`)    | **8 pts**        | Soft fail: minor deduction, still widely acceptable. |
| No "+all" (No permissive)   | **5 pts**        | Deduction if using permissive (`+all`).              |

### 2. DKIM (Total 30 points)

| Criterion                   | Points           | Explanation                                           |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| DKIM Record Exists          | **15 pts**       | DKIM signing is critical baseline.                   |
| DKIM Key Strength ≥1024-bit | **10 pts**       | 1024-bit keys acceptable; full points.               |
| DKIM Multiple Selectors     | **5 pts** *(bonus)* | Bonus for key rotation capability.                |

### 3. DMARC (Total 40 points)

| Criterion                   | Points           | Explanation                                           |
| DMARC Record Exists         | **10 pts**       | Basic DMARC setup for visibility.                    |
| DMARC Policy = Reject       | **20 pts**       | Full enforcement (optimal).                          |
| DMARC Policy = Quarantine   | **15 pts**       | Partial enforcement (acceptable).                    |
| DMARC Policy = None         | **5 pts**        | Monitoring-only; minimal credit.                     |
| DMARC Reporting (rua)       | **5 pts** *(bonus)* | Recommended reporting capability.                |

## Total Points Breakdown (Maximum = 100 + bonuses)

- SPF: 30 pts max
- DKIM: 30 pts max (+5 bonus points)
- DMARC: 40 pts max (+5 bonus points)

### Realistic Compliance Thresholds

| Total Points     | Rating          | Explanation                              |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **85–100**       | **Excellent**   | Optimal or near-optimal industry-standard configuration.|
| **70–84**        | **Good**        | Solid baseline; meets practical security standards. |
| **50–69**        | **Moderate**    | Common among major companies; safe but improvement advised.|
| **<50**          | **Poor**        | Significant risks; urgent action recommended.|

## **Actionable Recommendations to Improve Scores**

### If score is Poor (<50 pts):
- Immediately add missing SPF, DKIM, or DMARC records.
- Avoid using `+all` SPF policies; switch immediately to `~all` or `-all`.
- Ensure DKIM keys are at least 1024 bits (2048 bits recommended).
- Add DMARC policy (`p=quarantine` or `p=reject`) for enforcement.

### If score is Moderate (50–69 pts):
- Upgrade DMARC policy from `none` to at least `quarantine`.
- Move from SPF soft-fail (`~all`) to hard-fail (`-all`) when confident.
- Ensure multiple DKIM selectors exist for key rotation.
- Configure DMARC aggregate reporting (`rua`).

### If score is Good (70–84 pts):
- Consider moving DMARC to strict reject policy for full enforcement.
- Verify and optimize DKIM selectors and key rotation frequency.
- Continuously monitor DMARC reports to maintain compliance.
